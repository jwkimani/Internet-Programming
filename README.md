Section 01

Course Description
------------------

This course introduces current technologies for modeling, designing, implementing, and developing Web applications. 
Topics include developing for the server and the client, programming frameworks, server administration and integration 
with databases. Practice will involve platforms and language such as Linux, Python, PHP, Ruby and JavaScript.

Note that, while the course description mentions many Java based technologies as examples of the type covered in the 
course, this version of the course will not be using Java.

Prerequisites
-------------

C or better grade in CS 3540 and CS 3610

Resources
--------

These materials will be used to support the learning outcomes for this course, through readings, examples, and exercises.

We will be covering a wide range of subjects, so we will depend on online resources..

    HTML and CSS
        HTTP Made Really Easy
        For HTML and CSS, we will use the tutorials found at WebPlatform.org. Those materials emphasize standards-based web design.
    Python
        The Python Tutorial from the Python web site is up-to-date and covers the topics important for this course.
        Databases and Python
        Using Relational Databases with Python
        Python Wiki: Database Programming
        Python MySQL Database Access
    Django
        Django documentation found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/. This includes downloadable versions.
    For those who choose to use Linux/Unix, the following references may be helpful:
        Introduction to Linux
        Linux Tutorial
        bash Beginner's Guide
There are many software components that we will use in this course. Here is a list of the major ones:

    We will be using Python version 3.x.y (x ≥ 4) for server side programming.
    An IDE is important, you should choose one that provides good support for web development. Here are two good choices:
        PyCharm professional edition from JetBrains. This is not free, but we have a license that can be shared to support class related work. This is what the instructor will use in class and for development.
        The Eclipse IDE with Aptana Studio plugin. This is also available from Aptana in a single package. This combination will support all of the development work in this course.
    There will be two server platforms to choose from:
        The Mint distribution of Linux with the addition of the Apache web server and PostgreSQL
    Projects that use the browser must perform for the Firefox browser.

General Policies
----------------

Withdrawal Policy
-----------------

The last day to withdraw without academic penalty is March 10, 2014. Ceasing to attend class or oral notice thereof DOES NOT constitute official withdrawal from the course. Students who simply stop attending classes without officially withdrawing usually are assigned failing grades. Students wishing to withdraw after the scheduled change period (add/drop) must obtain and complete a withdrawal form from the Academic Services Department in the Registrar's Office.

Enrollment Policy
------------------
Only those students who are enrolled in the class may attend lectures, receive assignments, take quizzes and exams, and receive a grade in the class. If a student is administratively withdrawn from this course, they will not be permitted to attend class nor will they receive any grade for the class.

Electronic Devices
-------------------
In order to minimize the level of distraction, all beepers and cellular phones must be on quite mode during class meeting times. Students who wish to use a computer/PDA for note taking need prior approval of the instructor since key clicks and other noises can distract other students. Recording of lectures by any method requires prior approval of the instructor. Students using a laptop in class should not check their e-mail, browse the web, or in any other way detract from the focus of the class.

Classroom Behavior
------------------
Students are reminded to conduct themselves in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct, as published in the Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs. Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provision. For more details, refer to the KSU Student Code of Conduct, Section III. Students who are in violation of this policy will be asked to leave the classroom and may be subject to disciplinary action by the University.

Web Resources Usage
-------------------
Assessment
----------

Evaluation of your performance will be based on three components:

Assignments
------------
Midterm exam during class time
Final exam given at the prescribed times.
Each component will count a specific percentage towards your final grade:

Component	Percentage
Assignments	50%
Midterm	    25%
Final	    25%

Late Homework Policy
---------------------

Due dates for homework assignments will be specified on the assignments themselves. Please see the Assignments Index Page for the assignments themselves and for the late policy

Testing Policies
----------------

Policies on making up missed work vary according to the type:

Midterm and Final exam
Makeups will given if the test was missed for an acceptable reason and if the makeup is done soon enough.
Out of Class Assignments
These may not be made up. See above for the policy on turning these assignments in late.
Final Exam

The final exam will be December 9, 2014 from 10:30 to 12:30. Note, this is not the regular class time!

Timetable
--------

Please see the Notes Page for the topics and timing.

Special Dates
-------------

    8/19/2014 ==> First day of class
    9/30/2014 ==> Midterm exam
    10/8/2014 ==> Last day to withdraw without academic penalty
    11/24/2014 - 11/30/2014 ==> Fall break
    12/4/2014 ==> Last day of classes
    12/9/2014 ==> Final exam from 10:30 to 12:30 (Note!: this is not the regular class time)

Assistance Outside of Class
------------------
You may seek assistance outside of class from the instructor.

When you seek help it is important that you bring the necessary materials with you so that we can effectively advise you. If you are seeking help with classroom work bring your text and your classroom notes. If you are seeking help with pencil and paper exercises bring your text, your classroom notes, and whatever attempts you have made with the exercises.

If you are seeking help with a program make sure you bring a diskette or flash drive with the most current versions of all *.java files. Bring paper listings of these files. If you were getting error messages, record them as accurately as you can.

Again, bring your most current versions of your work. The ability to help you is GREATLY reduced without the current versions.

Student Course Evaluation
------------------
A standard questionnaire (described below) will be administered during the last two weeks of the semester in all classes. Additional questions developed by the college or instructor(s) may be included as well. It is important that each student provide meaningful feedback to the instructor(s) so that changes can be made in the course to continually improve its effectiveness. We value student feedback about the course, our teaching styles, and course materials, so as to improve our teaching and your learning. At a minimum, the following two questions will be asked: 1) Identify the aspects of the course that most contributed to your learning (include examples of specific materials, exercises and/or the faculty member's approach to teaching and mentoring), and 2) Identify the aspects of the course, if any, that might be improved (include examples of specific materials, exercises and/or the faculty member's approach to teaching and mentoring).

Acquiring Final Grades
------------------
In an effort to better utilize our technology resources, Kennesaw State University has instituted the reporting of end of term grades by phone. This is in addition to the web version of grades, which has been in effect for several terms. Students may call 770-420-4315 and select Option Number 4 to secure their end of term grades. With this new development, printed grade reports will not be mailed at the end of the term. Students needing verification of grades or enrollment should request either an official transcript or an enrollment verification through the Office of the Registrar.

Academic Integrity Statement
----------------------------
Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provisions of the Student Code of Conduct, as published in the Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs. Section II of the Student Code of Conduct addresses the University's policy on academic honesty, including provisions regarding plagiarism and cheating, unauthorized access to University materials, misrepresentation/falsification of University records or academic work, malicious removal, retention, or destruction of library materials, malicious/intentional misuse of computer facilities and/or services, and misuse of student identification cards. Incidents of alleged academic misconduct will be handled through the established procedures of the University Judiciary Program, which includes either an "informal" resolution by a faculty member, resulting in a grade adjustment, or a formal hearing procedure, which may subject a student to the Code of Conduct's minimum one semester suspension requirement.

Each student must fill out an "Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Academic Integrity Statement". These forms are available on line in HTML or PDF format. Print one of these, complete the requested information, sign the form and hand it in to your instructor.

Students are encouraged to study together and to work together on class assignments and lab exercises; however, the provisions of the STUDENT CONDUCT REGULATIONS, II. Academic Honesty, KSC Undergraduate Catalog will be strictly enforced in this class.

Frequently students will be provided with "take-home" exams or exercises. It is the student's responsibility to ensure they fully understand to what extent they may collaborate or discuss content with other students. No exam work may be performed with the assistance of others or outside material unless specifically instructed as permissible. If an exam or assignment is designated as 'no outside assistance' this includes, but is not limited to, peers, books, publications, the Internet and the WWW. If a student is instructed to provide citations for sources, proper use of citation support is expected. Additional information can be found at the following locations.
