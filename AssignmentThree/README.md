Creating a Web Page
===================

The file assignment3-style.css is the main stylesheet for these pages. Your task in this project is to create a two new 
web pages using features from assignment3-style.css according to the following requirements

>
- To orient the instructions, the pages should be _first.html_ and _second.html_
- _first.html_ should include examples of the following features:
    1. A definition list
    2. An ordered list with at least two levels using the outline class from the style sheet
    3. An ordered list with at least two levels with default styling
    4. A link to second.html
    5. A link to a page on an external web site
    6. A paragraph
- _second.html_ should include the following features:
    1. Put all the remaining contents of this page in a div with the id `content`.
    2. A table, at least 3 by 3, using the grid class
    3. A table, at least 3 by 3, using default styling
    4. Two levels of headers
    5. A paragraph with class `hint`. The assignment will use different colors, but try highlighting the area after 'Hint->'
        Like this!

The two html files will be tested by copying them to a folder that also contains the file assignment3-style.css. The 
files will be accessed either directly through the file system or through a web server.
